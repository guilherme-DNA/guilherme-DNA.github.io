I'm a Computer Science undergraduate student at the University of São Paulo (IME-USP). I started this blog due to a class, but after seeing some of my friends using it to share personal projects and what they've been developing, I decided to join them as well. I plan to post about things I’m working on and possibly some ideas I find interesting.
